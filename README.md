### Hello! I am Kyle Wong(he/him)...
I am a detail oriented software developer in the Denver Metro area.  Great UI, UX, and accessibility are things I am passionate about.  I believe that websites should be easy to use and access regardless of sex, gender, race, age, or ability.  My professional experiences have ranged from construction to butchery, model building to customer service.  All of these jobs include communication, team work, and problem solving; skills I hope to bring to a development team.  If i'm not coding you can find me skiing, skateboarding, hiking, and cooking.  Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or shoot me an email at the addresses above.  Thanks for stopping by!
